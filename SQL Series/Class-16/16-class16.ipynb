    "# GroupBy Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've made it this far in the course, then you already know the basics of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I assume that you know how to group rows by single or multiple columns and how to calculate aggregate functions: sums, averages, maximum values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s time to learn some of its advanced features! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll learn how to use ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause that allows you to attach additional lines which represent subtotals. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are often called super-aggregated rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "They can be presented together with the total sum line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the useful ROLLUP extension, you can generate multiple grouping sets using just one SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to ROLLUP, the CUBE extension allows you to generate subtotals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, CUBE generates subtotals for all combinations of grouping columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUPING SETS is another step further because it allows for computing multiple GROUP BY clauses in a single SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY GROUPING SETS is equivalent to the UNION of two or more GROUP BY operations in the same result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ROLLUP\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first get to know the tables that we'll use in this part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the tables here: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/q1yM9pKcshbvZehgqfMJGd/0\n",
    "\n",
    "Our examples will be based on a table named contest_score. You can check its contents using the button on the right side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  * \n",
    "FROM contest_score;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This table is used in a TV show in which contestants are given points for tasks in two categories: physical (Workout) and intellectual (Knowledge). scores from 1 to 10 are given over the course of five weeks to five contestants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table has the following columns: full_name, week, category, and score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second table is named delivery; it will be used in our exercises. It is used by a supermarket to keep track of all deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  * \n",
    "FROM delivery;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table has the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- supplier (the company that delivers the products).\n",
    "- category (such as Toys or Office).\n",
    "- delivery_date (when the products were delivered to the store).\n",
    "- totalprice (how much was paid for the whole delivery).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grouping by a single column\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly recap what you already know about grouping rows in SQL, here is a simple problem: suppose we want to know the average score for each TV show contestant over the course of five weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, we'd write the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  full_name,\n",
    "  AVG(score) AS avg_score\n",
    "FROM contest_score\n",
    "GROUP BY full_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple query, we grouped the results by a single column (full_name) and used the AVG() function to calculate the average score for each contestant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing really difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "How much, in total, was spent on deliveries for each category? Show two columns: category and the sum of total_price (as total).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  category, \n",
    "  SUM(total_price) AS total\n",
    "FROM delivery\n",
    "GROUP BY category;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grouping by multiple columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we know how well each contestant did in general, but we would also like to know how well they did on average in each category. To achieve that, we can add another column to the GROUP BY clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  full_name,\n",
    "  category, \n",
    "  AVG(score) AS avg_score\n",
    "FROM contest_score\n",
    "GROUP BY full_name, category;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this addition, we will now get each contestant's average score in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ROLLUP introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how well each contestant did in general (GROUP BY full_name), and also how well they did in each category (GROUP BY full_name, category). \n",
    "\n",
    "But note one thing: by adding the second column to the GROUP BY clause, we lost some information from the previous query.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `GROUP BY full_name, category clause`, we know the average scores for each contestant in each category, but we are no longer able to check the overall average for each contestant.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where GROUP BY ROLLUP comes in handy. Take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  full_name,\n",
    "  category, \n",
    "  AVG(score) AS avg_score\n",
    "FROM contest_score\n",
    "GROUP BY ROLLUP (full_name, category);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the change in the GROUP BY clause. We added the ROLLUP operator, followed by a pair of parentheses. Inside, we put full_name and category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what changes when we use ROLLUP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from averages by contestant and category, we can also see averages by contestant and an overall average across all contestants and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "e see that ROLLUP added two new rows to the query result: overall averages for each contestant and a general overall average for all contestants.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Show how much was spent for each category on each day, for each category in general, and for all days and all categories. \n",
    "\n",

    "GROUP BY ROLLUP(category, delivery_date\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Order of columns in ROLLUP\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may have noticed that when we wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  full_name,\n",
    "  category, \n",
    "  AVG(score) AS avg_score\n",
    "FROM contest_score\n",
    "GROUP BY ROLLUP (full_name, category);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we got the following groupings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Average by full_name and category\n",
    "2. Average by full_name\n",
    "3. Overall average\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we saw the full_name average, but we didn't see an average for category only. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's because the column order matters in ROLLUP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the template code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "2. Average by category\n",
    "3. Overall average\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that by reversing the order of the columns inside the ROLLUP's parentheses, we changed one of the groupings.\n",
    "\n",
