    "For instance, such structures are used when talking about superior and inferior employees, railway connections, application menus, etc.\n",

    "What we're going to show here is standard syntax, but you may expect some deviations in various databases. \n",

    "In SQL, we talk about a recursive CTE when that CTE refers to itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind recursive CTEs is usually as follows: 'Hey, give me everything you have so far, but add something extra as well. Then, repeat this procedure until I tell you to stop. By adding small pieces in each recursive step, I expect to finally arrive at the right result.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds vague? \n",

    "Let's say we want to show numbers from 1 to 10, but we don't have any table with rows containing those numbers.\n",

    "# Recursion Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "As you could see, we got rows containing numbers from 1 to 10 without actually using any table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to explain the magic behind that query. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take another look at the template from the previous exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://learnsql.com/static/common-table-expressions-Part4_diagrams1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Postgresql, a recursive CTE starts with the words WITH RECURSIVE, followed by the CTE name and the list of columns in the parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our CTE under the name counter has only one column, which is the previous_value (that is, the value shown in the previous step).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each correctly constructed recursive CTE has three essential elements inside the parentheses: an anchor member, a recursive member and a terminator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `anchor member` is basically something (an anchor point) that we start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we want to show numbers from 1 to 10, we will start with the number 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could think of it as the smallest matryoshka doll which is so small that it has no other matryoshka doll inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the anchor member is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the `recursive member`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive member tells us what to do in each recursive step. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of matryoshka dolls, this could be: create a bigger matryoshka doll which will have the previous matryoshka doll inside it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there we go with numbers: given that you have all rows with numbers generated so far, add another row with a number that is bigger by 1 than the number in the row previously generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT previous_value + 1\n",
    "FROM counter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the CTE counter refers to itself (FROM counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we stopped at this point, our query would go on and on, and it would never stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our real-life examples, each recursion comes to an end: there is the biggest matryoshka doll that holds all smaller dolls inside itself, just as there is the biggest cone in a Romanesco broccoli.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a terminator in recursive CTEs as well: something that will eventually stop our recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it's\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "WHERE previous_value < 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: as long as the previous value is smaller than 10, continue with the recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you reach 10, don't add any new rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a recursive CTE has nothing new to add in a given step, it terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the remaining parts of our example query. I'll show it again here again for your convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://learnsql.com/static/common-table-expressions-Part4_diagrams1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, note that we used `UNION ALL` to join the anchor member (`SELECT 1`) with all further recursive steps (`SELECT previous_value + 1`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `UNION ALL`, we could also use `UNION`, which will remove duplicate values from the recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, no duplicate values exist, so there is no difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the recursive CTE is completed and our temporary table is created, we need to query this table to actually see any results. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we put\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM counter\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "outside the CTE. This part of the query is called `invocation`.\n",

    "The animation below shows how our final recursive table is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://learnsql.com/static/common-table-expressions-Part4_diagrams2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically speaking, recursive CTEs do not use recursion, but iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, as the SQL keyword for this kind of queries is RECURSIVE, it is common to call such queries recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Treat it as some sort of convention rather than a technically accurate description.\n",
