    "Let's take a look at it.\n",

    "# Ranking functions - introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get down to work. So far, you've learned how to use window functions with aggregate functions that you already know – SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MAX() and MIN().\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll teach you different functions that go well with OVER() – ranking functions. The general syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<ranking function> OVER (ORDER BY <order by columns>)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll introduce a few possible ranking functions in the next exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to OVER (ORDER BY col1, col2...), this is the part where you specify the order in which rows should be sorted and therefore ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function RANK()\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright. We'll start with the most widely used ranking function: RANK(). The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What does RANK() do? \n",
    "\n",
    "It returns the rank (a number) of each row with respect to the sorting specified within parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY sorts rows and shows them in a specific order to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ...) is a function that shows the rank(place, position) of each row in a separate column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example from our database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  name,\n",
    "  platform,\n",
    "  editor_rating,\n",
    "  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY editor_rating)\n",
    "FROM game;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three columns are quite obvious, but look what happens next: we want to return the rank (RANK()) of each row when we sort them by the column editor_rating (OVER(ORDER BY editor_rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the result of the example query.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we get the rank of each game in the last column. There are 3 games with the lowest score – 4. All of them got rank 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next game, with score 5, got rank 4, not 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's how RANK() works. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There were three games before the game with score 5, so, being the 4th game, it got rank 4 – regardless of the fact that the other three all got rank 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "RANK() will always leave gaps in numbering when more than 1 row share the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "For each game, show name, genre, date of update and its rank. The rank should be created with RANK() and take into account the date of update."

    "- RANK() – returns the rank (a number) of each row with respect to the sorting specified within parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DENSE_RANK() – returns a 'dense' rank, i.e. there are no gaps in numbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROW_NUMBER() – returns a unique rank number, so even rows with the same value get consecutive numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NTILE(x) – distributes the rows into a specific number of groups, provided as x.\n",

    "# General syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we're finally going to learn about window frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Window frames define precisely which rows should be taken into account when computing the results and are always relative to the current row. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can create new kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you may say that for each row, 3 rows before and 3 rows after it are taken into account; or rows from the beginning of the partition until the current row. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a moment, you'll discover how such queries can come in handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the example window frame, where two rows before and two rows after the current row are selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= 'https://learnsql.com/static/postgresql-window-functions-window-functions-part5-ex5.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two kinds of window frames: those with the keyword ROWS and those with RANGE instead. The general syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<window function> OVER (...\n",
    "  ORDER BY <order_column>\n",
    "  [ROWS|RANGE] <window frame extent>\n",
    "  )\n",
    "```\n",
    "Of course, other elements might be added above (for instance, a PARTITION BY clause), which is why we put dots (...) in the brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll focus on the meaning of ROWS and RANGE. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about PARTITION BY later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  id,\n",
    "  total_price,\n",
    "  SUM(total_price) OVER(\n",
    "    ORDER BY placed\n",
    "    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)\n",
    "FROM single_order;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above query, we sum the column total_price. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each row, we add the current row AND all the previously introduced rows (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) to the sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the sum will increase with each new order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Window frame definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's jump into the brackets of OVER(...) and discuss the details. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with ROWS, because they are a bit easier to explain than RANGE. The general syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ROWS BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You know BETWEEN already – it's used to define a range. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've used it to define a range of values – this time, we're going to use it to define a range of rows instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the two bounds? \n",
    "\n",
    "The bounds can be any of the five options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` – the first possible row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PRECEDING` – the n-th row before the current row (instead of n, write the number of your choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CURRENT ROW` – simply current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FOLLOWING` – the n-th row after the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` – the last possible row.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower bound must come BEFORE the upper bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a construction like: `...ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` doesn't make sense and you'll get an error if you run it.\n",

    "FROM single_order\n",
    "ORDER BY placed;\n",
    "```\n",

    "The query computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the total price of all orders placed so far (this kind of sum is called a running total).\n",
