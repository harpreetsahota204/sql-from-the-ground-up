    "# Window Functions, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to talk about `window functions` in PostgreSQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL window functions make building complex aggregations much simpler. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are so powerful that they serve as a dividing point in time: people talk about SQL before window functions and SQL after window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After window functions and Common Table Expressions were introduced to the language, SQL has become [`Turing complete`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPQD7-AOjMI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are a relatively new addition to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were originally standardized with SQL:2003. \n",
    "\n",
    "Postgres has supported window functions since PostgreSQL 8.4. It was the first major database system to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start from the very beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step by step, you will learn new elements that make up window functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that at the end of our course, you will take one more look at that scary example and think: this is now so easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a window function exactly? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a function that performs calculations across a set of table rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rows are somehow related to the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with window functions you can compute sum of values in the current row, one before and one after, as in the [picture](https://learnsql.com/static/postgresql-window-functions-window-functions-part2-ex4.gif):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'https://learnsql.com/static/postgresql-window-functions-window-functions-part2-ex4.gif'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it window functions precisely because the set of rows is called a window or a window frame. Take a look at the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "<window_function> OVER (...)\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "`<window_function>` can be an aggregate function that you already know (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` etc.), or another function, such as a ranking or an analytical function that you'll get to know in the coming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window frame is defined in the `OVER(...)` clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "The large part of the course explains how to define the window frame with `OVER(...)`. T\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we're going to talk about in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "What functions can you use with PARTITION BY? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an aggregate function that you already know (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.), or another function, such as a ranking or an analytical function that you'll get to know in the coming lectures.\n",
