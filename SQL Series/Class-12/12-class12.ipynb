    "# Window Functions, Part 3: Analytic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to introduce a few widely used analytic functions that are often used with window functions. Thanks to them, you'll be able to write queries that are useful when making business decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkout the fiddle here:https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/vYW8BSKZHVwKzbgXd8GY5u/3\n",

    "Now, let's explore the tables!\n",
    "\n",
    "# The website table\n",
    "\n",
    "Select all the information from the website table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each website has an id, name, monthly budget and the date of opening (opened).\n",

    "Select all the information from the statistics table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, you can find the statistics from May 2016. Each generated statistics row corresponds to a certain website_id and a particular day. Column users shows how many unique people visited the website that day. Column impressions indicates how many times an advertisement was shown to a user. clicks means the number of clicks on an advertisement. Column revenue is the total profit generated by those clicks on that day.\n",

    "# General Syntax\n",

    "<analytic function> OVER (...)\n",

    "Looks familiar? That's right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic functions are quite easy, their syntax is identical to aggregate functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that aggregate functions calculate a cumulative result for all the rows in the window frame, while the analytic functions refer to single rows within the frame.\n",
    "\n",
