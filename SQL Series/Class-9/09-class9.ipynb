    "\n",
    "The construction we've mentioned at the beginning is `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END` (commonly called just `CASE WHEN`). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever used any programming language, you could think of it as an if-then-else type of logic. If you haven't, don't worry – we'll get to that in a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two similar versions of CASE expressions: a simple CASE WHEN and a searched CASE WHEN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first one and give you an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  CASE fee\n",
    "    WHEN 50 THEN 'normal'\n",
    "    WHEN 10 THEN 'reduced'\n",
    "    WHEN 0 THEN 'free'\n",
    "    ELSE 'not available'\n",
    "  END\n",
    "FROM application;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks complicated? Let's discuss it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `CASE WHEN` adds a new column to the result of the query, so that's why it usually goes into the `SELECT` clause with the other columns, before the `FROM` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, CASE WHEN takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a list of one or more values, each value is listed after WHEN,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. a list of return values, each return value is listed after THEN of the appropriate condition,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. an optional ELSE part with a default value for situations where none of the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`CASE WHEN` always ends with `END`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, there are a few options in the column fee of the table application. The candidate may pay a full application fee (50), a reduced one (10), may not have to pay at all (0) or the payment information may be unavailable for some reason (NULL). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of showing these values, we change them to more descriptive ones (normal, reduced etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after the keyword `CASE` we name the column of interest (fee), and then we provide a few possible value scenarios for this column (`WHEN 50 ..., WHEN 10 ..., WHEN 0 ...`), instructing our database what to print in each of these cases (`... THEN 'normal', ... THEN 'reduced', ... THEN 'free'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of the values matches the one we find in a given row, then the ELSE part is executed (ELSE 'not available'). In this way, we can control the output of our queries.\n",
