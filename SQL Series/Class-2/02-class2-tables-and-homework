EXERCISES

1. Select the names of all pieces of art together with the names of the museums that house them in their collections, as well as the countries in which these museums are located. Show also pieces of art which were lost.

2. For each artist who lived for more than 50 years and was born after the year 1800, show their name and the name of the pieces of art they created. Rename columns to artist_name and piece_name, respectively.

3. Show the names of all pieces of art together with the names of their creators and the names of the museums that house these pieces of art in their collections. Omit lost works and pieces of art with an unknown artist. Name the columns piece_of_art_name, artist_name, and museum_name.

4. Check whether there are any pieces that were created by unknown artists. Show the names of these pieces together with the names of the museums that house the pieces in their collections.

5. For each piece of art that is housed in either an American (USA) or Italian (Italy) museum, show both its name (as piece_name) and the name of its artist (as artist_name).
